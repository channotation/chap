CHAP is written in C++ and is developed and tested on Ubuntu Linux. It is expected to be portable to other Unix-like operating systems, although this has not been tested thoroughly.

## Using a singularity image ##

This is the simplest solution and involves just two steps.  The following is for linux (ubuntu):

1.  Install singularity

```sh
sudo apt-get install singularity
```
(or follow the singularity installation guide: https://sylabs.io/guides/3.8/user-guide/quick_start.html) 

2.  Obtain the singularity image with chap precompiled and ready to go

```sh
wget https://github.com/channotation/chap/tree/singularity_branch/singularity_images/chap_singularity_version2.simg
```

That's it - then you are good to go!  The below example is for the TRPA1 channel structure (PDB code: 6v9X):

```sh
singularity shell --nv chap_singularity_version2.simg

chap -f 6v9x.pdb -s 6v9x.pdb -sel-pathway 1
```

This installs a singularity version2 image file.  A version 3 is also available though singularity images are backward compatible so its really only necessary if you already have singulairty version 3 installed.

If you analyse gromacs trajectories, you need to input a tpr file generated by gromacs 2018 or older. You can use the gromacs version installed in the singularity container to regenerate the tpr file corresponding to your trajectory. 

If you want to install it yourself then the instructions below will only work with gromacs up to version 2018.

The following installation guide will assume that you are using Ubuntu and that you are reasonably experienced in using the command line.

## Downloading CHAP ##

To obtain a copy of CHAP, visit the [Releases Section][CHAP-Download] on GitHub and download the archive corresponding to the desired version. Alternatively, you can download the code directly from the command line via:

```sh
wget https://github.com/channotation/chap/archive/version_0_9_1.tar.gz
```

As CHAP is still a young project with new features and bug fixes being added continuously, you will usually want to download the latest version.


## Prerequisites ##

Prior to installing CHAP, make sure that you have the following libraries and tools installed:

1. The [CMake][CMake] tool in version 3.2 or higher. This will typically be available through your system's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu you can install CMake by typing `sudo apt-get install cmake`. CMake is used to check the availability of libraries and compilers on your system and will ensure that CHAP is installed properly.
2. A C++ compiler that supports the `C++11` standard. A popular choice is the [GNU Compiler Collection][GCC], which on Ubuntu can be obtained by typing `sudo apt-get install gcc`
3. The [Boost][Boost] C++ libraries, which on Ubuntu can be installed using `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`. Boost algorithms are used in CHAP to solve some root finding and optimisation problems.
4. The CBLAS and LAPACKE linear algebra libraries. On Ubuntu, the easiest way to obtain these is by typing `sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapacke-dev libatlas-base-dev libopenblas-dev`. The linear algebra libraries are used in CHAP's spline interpolation.
5. The `libgromacs` library of the [Gromacs][Gromacs] molecular dynamics engine in version 2016 or higher. Comprehensive installation instructions for Gromacs can be found [here][Gromacs-install].
Please note that for using Gromacs as a library, the underlying FFTW libray
may **not** be installed automatically, i.e. you need to set
`-DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=OFF` when running CMake during the Gromacs
installation.

CHAP also depends on [RapidJSON](http://rapidjson.org/), but this is included as a header-only library, and on [GTest][GTest], but this is downloaded and installed automatically by CMake, so you don't need to do anything about either of these (you will however need Internet access when installing CHAP).


## Compiling and Installing CHAP  ##

To install CHAP, unpack the source, create a `build` directory parallel to the source tree and from there run `cmake`, `make`, `make check`, and `make install`.

```bash
tar -xvzf version_0_8_0.tar.gz
cd chap-version_0_8_0
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make check
sudo make install
```

CMake will automatically find all dependencies (and inform you of missing ones), `make` will compile the code (you can use the `make -j` flag to speed this up on multicore machines), `make check` runs a suite of unit tests, and `make install` will place the binary in `/usr/local/chap/bin` (so you will need sudo rights for this last step). To check if CHAP has been installed properly, you can type

```bash
chap -h
```

which should bring up an online help for using CHAP.
