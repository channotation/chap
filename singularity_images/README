# Using sigularity containers for chap

The .sif file was build with singularity version3. 
The .simg file was build with version2 of singularity.
Type "singularity --version" in your terminal to check 
which version is installed on your machine.
If you have version 3 installed, you can use both the .sif or the .simg file.
If you have version 2 installed, you can only use the .simg file.

### installing singularity ###
version 2: https://sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/singularity_flow.html
version 3: https://sylabs.io/guides/3.8/user-guide/quick_start.html

### version 2 of singularity ###
singularity shell --nv chap_singularity_version2.simg

### version 3 of singularity ###
singularity shell --nv chap_sing.sif

### Usage ###
chap -f 6v9x.pdb -s 6v9x.pdb -sel-pathway 1

The file 6v9x.pdb is just an example.
After being in the singularity environment, you have to change directorty 
to the folder where your trajectories/pdb files are stored to use chap for
analysis. Or you load the files in the same folder where the singularity
folder is stored.

### tpr files ###
If you analyse gromacs trajctories, you need to input a *.tpr file generated by
gromacs 2018 or older. We are currently working on updating chap such that it can 
read tpr files from current gromacs versions.

### Installing singularity for windows/mac ###

Linux container runtimes like Singularity cannot run natively on Windows or Mac 
because of basic incompatibilities with the host kernel.

For this reason, the Singularity community maintains a set of Vagrant Boxes via Vagrant Cloud, 
one of Hashicorpâ€™s open source tools. The current versions can be found under the sylabs organization.

Sylabs has also developed a beta version of Singularity Desktop for Mac, 
which runs Singularity in a lightweight virtual machine, in a transparent manner.
