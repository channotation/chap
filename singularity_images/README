# Using sigularity containers for chap
The .sif file was build with singularity version3. 
The .simg file was build with version2 of singularity.
Type "singularity --version" in your terminal to check 
which version is installed on your machine.
If you have version 3 instlled, you can use both the .sif or the .simg file.
If you have version 2 installed, you can only use the .simg file.

analysis. Or you load the files in the same folder where the singularity
folder is stored.
